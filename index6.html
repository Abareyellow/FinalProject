  <h1> Impact </h1>
  <p> The impact of the decline of population is that economy will go down with the population itself. If Japan economy goes down quickly, we are going to lose big money on candies, snacks, and anime. This is going to be a big issue for companies like Crunchyroll and Funimation that simulcast us anime if their no long any anime to bring to the U.S. The benefit is that Japan has good eating habits people will stay around for years but if they're not producing children the economy is going to fly down quickly.
