  <h1> Women in Japan </h1>
  <p>   Blame has been put on the young people in Japan, but the girls are ones to get more blame than boys. In Japanese traditons for marriage, Women are the ones to take care of the children while the men works all day. Now thanks to women empowerment, girls no longer what to be housewives and take care of the children. Marriage usually ends a woman's working career, even though most women are well educated as well. 70 percent of women quit working after they have their first child and depend on their husband salaries. This traditional Japanese family model has lost much of attractiveness for young woman because they want more out than being a housewives.
