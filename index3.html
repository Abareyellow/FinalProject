  <h1> When did this issue begins? </h1>
  <p>
 The issue begins with one simple word that all American teens know by heart - sex. Yes, sex is the one thing that's missing in Japan. Japanese youth have lost interest in having relationships and sex. Don't believe that this is an issue, a suvrey that was done ask young women and men if their interest in having sex. The result came out to be 45% of women and 25% of men were not interested in a relationship with the opposite sex. Also, there is a cultral and economic barrier that causing the issue as well. In Japanese tradition, marriage is about duty more than love. The men reponsible were to go to work and women are the one at home raising the children all day. Japan's economny has expanded since then and now they need women to work the same hours of that men work. Marriges ends women's working careered, even if most women are well educated. Women, after having babies, are social pressure to quit thier jobs in order to do what tradition calls for a women. Mothers try to find a job to keep working but they're stigmatized.
