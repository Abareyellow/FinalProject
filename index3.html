  <h1> When did this issue begins? </h1>
  <p>
 The issue begins with young men and women in Japan not having relationships at an early age. Yes, sex is the one thing that's missing in Japan youth. Japanese youth have lost interest in having relationships. Don't believe that this is an issue, a suvrey that was done ask young women and men if their interest in having a relationship. The result came out to be 45% of women and 25% of men were not interested in a relationship with the opposite sex. Young people in Japan have friends and relationships - they're just not settling down. This is the cause of Japan's population decline are both impacting economically and socially. Marriage remain the only socially acceptable way to have children to have children. How can this happen to Japan? </p>
