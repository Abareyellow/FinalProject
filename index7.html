  <h1> Men </h1>
  <p> The blame has been put on young people but the blame is on more girls than boys. The men in Japan are more of the person who does the work and does not have to worry about raising the children. Men in Japan spend an average of one hour a day helping with the children and household chores. Young men, like young women, are now not interest in having sex. Their a myth about man and the interest in relationships. It called Celibacy Syndrome which short for young males who, for some reason, don't have interest in sex. Now with the reason decrease in job oppotunities for young people, men can't find a good job to with stand a family. Men who don't have a regular or good job are not considered marriages parnters. </p>
